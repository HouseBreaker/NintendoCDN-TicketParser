# PlaiCDN-TitleIdParser
Using PlaiCDN, checks a decrypted title keys file for the legit title keys, looks through 3dsdb for them, and gets info about them.

#Disclaimer
You can use this program to download legit backups of the games you bought in case you need to. I don't care and am not liable for anything else piracy-related that you do with it.

#Dependencies
.NET Framework 4.5.2

Also, the internet. This downloads stuff it needs if it isn't present.

#Running it
You need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [PlaiCDN](https://github.com/Plailect/PlaiCDN/blob/master/PlaiCDN.py) and a copy of [the 3dsdb.com database](http://3dsdb.com/xml.php) in the directory where the exe is. If PlaiCDN or the database aren't there, it'll download it automatically.

Also you need a copy of your decrypted title keys, which you can get using [Decrypt9](https://gbatemp.net/threads/download-decrypt9-open-source-decryption-tools-wip.388831/)
